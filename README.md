# the main purpose of this code is to count the ordinary numbers that are inferior to the given number

- Initialize a counter count to 0 to keep track of ordinary numbers.
- Loop through each digit from 1 to 9.
- For each digit, generate ordinary numbers by repeating the digit (e.g., 1, 11, 111, 1111, etc.).
- Keep generating and counting ordinary numbers until they exceed 𝑛
- For each ordinary number that is less than or equal to 𝑛 , increment the counter.
- Return the total count of ordinary numbers.
- In the main function, handle multiple test cases, input 𝑛 , and output the result of the counting function for each test case.
