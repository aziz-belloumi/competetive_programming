#The main purpose of this code is to create the maximum sum of a number using prime numbers and to do that we must use the numbers 2 and 3
- Handling Special Cases (n == 2 and n == 3): Special cases for n = 2 and n = 3 are handled separately, as they each have a unique prime representation.
- Even n Case: For even n, the maximum number of primes is achieved by representing n entirely with the prime number 2.
- Odd n Case: For odd n, you subtract 3 (the smallest odd prime), then represent the remaining even number using the prime number 2.
