# the main purpose of this code is to find the minimum difference between the strength levemls between the athletes 


- Read the number of test cases t.
- For each test case, read the integer n (number of elements) and then read n elements into a vector a.
- Find the maximum element in the vector and store it in diff.
- Use nested loops to compare every pair of elements in the vector and update diff with the smallest absolute difference found.
- Print the smallest difference diff.
