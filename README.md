- a and b represent the endpoints of the first line segment.
- c and d represent the endpoints of the second line segment.
- Checks if the maximum of the first segment (max(a, b)) is less than the minimum of the second segment (min(c, d)), which means the first segment ends before the second segment starts.
- Checks if the minimum of the first segment (min(a, b)) is greater than the maximum of the second segment (max(c, d)), which means the first segment starts after the second segment ends.
- If either of the overlap conditions is true, the line segments do not overlap, and it prints "NO".
- If neither condition is true, the line segments overlap, and it prints "YES".
