# the main purpose of this code is to find the minimum number that should be substracted from the each member in the array so that every one has the same number (it's like fair distribution)

- Read the number of test cases, t.
- For each test case, read n, the number of boxes.
- Read the number of candies in each box into a vector.
- Find the minimum number of candies in the vector.
- Calculate the total candies to be eaten by summing the differences between each box's candies and the minimum value.
- Print the result for each test case
